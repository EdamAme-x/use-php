# PHP on Netlify Edge Functions!

This is an example of running PHP in a Netlify Edge Function using WebAssembly. It uses [php-wasm](https://github.com/seanmorris/php-wasm), which is a WebAssembly build of PHP.

The interesting code is [here](https://github.com/ascorbic/php-edge/blob/main/netlify/edge-functions/php.ts).

Try it yourself:
